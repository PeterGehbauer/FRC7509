Welcome! Today we set up this repository for storing (mostly) robot code but we may find that other resources could go here too!<br<br>

Brainstorm Robotics is a small robotics team at the Six Nations Polytechnic STEAM Academy, Brantford Campus, in Brantford Ontario.
Students chose the name not because Brainstorming is a useful problem solving and collaboration tool, rather because of the struggles
that many face on a daily basis.<br><br>

To learn more about Brainstorm Robotics or to support the team please contact us at robotics@snpsteam.com - thank you!<br><br>
